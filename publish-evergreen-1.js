This is a step-by-step breakdown of what actually works in 2025, based on what blogs like Cry808 look for when deciding who to feature.

## Why Most Submissions Get Ignored

Let's be real: most artists submit music the wrong way. They treat it like throwing darts in the dark, hoping something sticks.

**Here's what blogs see every day:**
- Generic emails that could've been sent to 100 different blogs
- Links to full albums when blogs want single tracks
- No context about who the artist is or why they matter
- Artists who've clearly never read a single article on the blog they're submitting to
- Follow-up emails two days later asking "did you listen yet?"

The problem isn't that your music is bad. The problem is that you're competing with dozens of other artists who are submitting the exact same way. Blogs have limited time and space—they can't feature everyone, so they feature the artists who make it easy for them.

**Understanding this changes everything.** When you approach **underground rap blogs** with a strategy instead of spray-and-pray tactics, your response rate will skyrocket.

---

## Step 1: Research The Right Blogs (Don't Waste Time On Dead Ends)

Not all rap blogs are created equal. Some have massive audiences but only cover major-label artists. Others are small but have dedicated fanbases in your exact niche.

**Here's how to find blogs worth your time:**

### Look For Active Blogs

Check their last post date. If they haven't posted in three months, they're either dead or not actively looking for submissions. Focus on blogs that post at least weekly.

### Match Your Sound To Their Coverage

Spend 20 minutes reading a blog's recent articles. What kind of artists do they feature? If they only cover lo-fi boom-bap and you make rage beats, you're wasting everyone's time.

**Pro tip:** Look at their "About" page or submission guidelines if they have them. Some blogs explicitly say what they're looking for.

### Check Their Engagement

A blog with 10,000 engaged followers is worth more than one with 100,000 dead followers. Look at comments, shares, and social media interaction. Are people actually engaging with the content, or is it just numbers?

### Prioritize Regional And Niche Blogs

Yes, you want to be on Pitchfork eventually. But right now? Focus on blogs that cover your city's scene or your specific subgenre. These blogs have audiences that are more likely to actually care about your music.

**Create a spreadsheet** with 10-20 blogs that genuinely fit your sound. This is your target list. Quality over quantity, always.

---

## Step 2: Build A Strong Foundation Before You Submit

Blogs want to feature artists who look like they're going somewhere. You don't need millions of streams, but you do need to show momentum.

**Before you submit, make sure you have:**

### A Professional Online Presence

- Your Spotify/Apple Music page is complete with a bio and artist photo
- Your Instagram looks active (posting regularly, engaging with your community)
- Your SoundCloud or Bandcamp has a consistent aesthetic
- Your website (if you have one) actually works and has your best music front and center

### At Least One Strong Release

Don't submit half-finished loosies. Blogs want polished tracks with professional mixing, proper artwork, and ideally an accompanying visual or music video.

### Some Level Of Traction

You don't need 100K followers, but you should have:
- At least a few hundred organic streams
- Some genuine engagement (comments, shares, DMs from real fans)
- Maybe a few local shows or collaborations under your belt

**Why this matters:** Blogs are taking a risk on you. They're telling their audience, "This artist is worth your time." If you look like you just started making music yesterday, it's a harder sell.

---

## Step 3: Craft A Submission That Actually Gets Read

Here's the reality: blog editors get dozens of emails a day. Most get deleted within 5 seconds. Your job is to survive that first 5-second filter.

**Here's the formula that works:**

### Subject Line: Keep It Simple

Bad: "🔥🔥🔥 FIRE NEW TRACK YOU NEED TO HEAR 🔥🔥🔥"
Good: "New single from [Your Name] - [Genre] from [City]"

The goal isn't to be clever. The goal is to communicate exactly what you're sending so they can decide if it's relevant.

### Opening Line: Show You Did Your Homework

Bad: "Dear Sir/Madam, I am an artist..."
Good: "Hey [Editor Name], I loved your recent feature on [Artist They Covered]—their sound is similar to what I'm doing with [Your Sound]."

This proves you're not mass-emailing. It shows you actually read the blog and understand what they cover.

### Introduce Yourself In 2-3 Sentences

Who are you? Where are you from? What's your sound? What's your story?

**Example:** "I'm Marcus, a Detroit rapper blending scam rap production with introspective lyricism. I've been grinding in the city's underground for three years, building a local following through DIY shows and consistent releases."

That's specific, concise, and tells the editor exactly what to expect.

### One Track, One Link

Don't send your entire discography. Blogs want to know what your BEST track is right now. Send one link (preferably a private SoundCloud or Spotify link) to your strongest, most recent release.

Include basic info:
- Track title
- Release date
- Producer credits (if relevant)
- Quick description (10-20 words max)

### Include Streaming Numbers If They're Good

If your track has 10K+ streams, mention it. If it has 200 streams, don't. Only include numbers if they help your case.

### Attach A Press Photo (Optional But Helpful)

Not required, but blogs appreciate having a high-quality press photo they can use if they decide to feature you. Make it a JPG, 1MB or less, professional quality.

### End With A Clear Call-To-Action

"If this fits what you're looking for, I'd love to see it featured on Cry808. Let me know if you need anything else from me—press kit, interview, etc. Thanks for your time."

**That's it. Short, professional, informative.** If they're interested, they'll listen. If not, nothing you say in the email will change their mind.

---

## Step 4: Timing Matters More Than You Think

When you send your submission can be just as important as what you send.

**Here's what works:**

### Submit 2-4 Weeks Before Your Release

Most blogs plan their coverage in advance. If you email them the day your song drops, they probably can't fit it into their schedule. Give them lead time.

### Avoid Mondays And Fridays

Monday mornings are when editors are catching up from the weekend and clearing their inbox. Friday afternoons are when people are checking out mentally. **Tuesday through Thursday, mid-morning to early afternoon, is optimal.**

### Don't Submit During Major Release Weeks

If Kendrick just dropped an album, every blog is scrambling to cover it. Your underground single will get buried. Pay attention to the news cycle and submit when competition is lower.

---

## Step 5: The Follow-Up (Without Being That Person)

You sent your submission. Now what?

**Wait at least 7-10 days before following up.** Blogs are busy. They're not ignoring you—they're just triaging hundreds of submissions.

**If you do follow up, keep it short:**

"Hey [Name], following up on the track I sent last week. No rush—just wanted to make sure it didn't get lost in your inbox. Let me know if you need anything else. Thanks!"

**Never follow up more than once.** If they didn't respond after your follow-up, they're either not interested or too busy. Move on to the next blog.

---

## Step 6: Build Real Relationships (The Long Game)

Getting one feature is great. Building a relationship with a blog so they cover you repeatedly? That's the goal.

**Here's how:**

### Engage With Their Content

Comment on their posts. Share articles you genuinely like. DM them when they feature an artist you fuck with. Be a real human, not a robot trying to extract value.

### Submit Consistently (But Not Too Often)

If they featured your single, wait a few months before submitting again. Don't become the artist who emails them every two weeks with a new loosie.

### Offer Value Beyond Your Music

Can you write a guest article about your city's scene? Can you connect them with other dope artists in your network? Think about how you can help the blog, not just how they can help you.

### Be Cool When They Pass

If a blog says "not a fit for us right now," don't argue or ask why. Just say "appreciate you checking it out—maybe next time!" and move on. Stay professional. Bridges aren't worth burning.

## Common Mistakes That Kill Your Chances

Let's run through the things that immediately disqualify submissions:

**❌ Sending Spotify links instead of press-quality files**
If they want to feature you, they might need a WAV or high-quality MP3. Make it easy.

**❌ Not having your artist name in the subject line**
They can't search for you later if your email just says "New Music."

**❌ Asking them to "check out your SoundCloud" with no specific track**
Which song? Your best work should be obvious and front-and-center.

**❌ Submitting music that doesn't fit the blog's vibe at all**
If they cover underground boom-bap and you make mainstream trap, why are you wasting their time?

**❌ Getting defensive when they don't respond**
Silence isn't personal. They're just busy. Move on.

**❌ Buying followers or streams and thinking blogs won't notice**
They will. And it kills your credibility instantly.

## What Happens After You Get Featured?

Congratulations—a blog posted your music. Now what?

**Maximize the coverage:**

- Share the article on all your platforms (tag the blog, thank them publicly)
- Engage with comments on the blog post
- Add the feature to your press kit for future submissions
- Use it as social proof when reaching out to other blogs or venues

**One feature leads to another.** Once you have a few blog placements, other blogs are more likely to take you seriously. It's a snowball effect.

---

## The Bottom Line

Learning **how to get on rap blogs** isn't rocket science, but it does require intention. Most artists fail because they treat submissions like a lottery instead of a process.

**Here's the recap:**

1. Research blogs that actually match your sound
2. Build a strong foundation before you submit
3. Craft professional, personalized emails
4. Time your submissions strategically
5. Follow up once (politely), then move on
6. Focus on building real relationships, not transactional one-offs

The underground rap ecosystem needs more artists who understand how to navigate it properly. **Underground rap blogs** like Cry808 exist to shine light on dope music that deserves attention. But we can only find you if you make it easy for us.

Do the work. Be strategic. Stay consistent. The coverage will come.
